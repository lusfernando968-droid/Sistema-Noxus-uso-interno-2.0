# Sound Files

This directory contains sound effect files for the application.

## Required Files

You need to add the following MP3 files to this directory:

1. **click.mp3** - Soft click sound for button interactions
2. **success.mp3** - Success/completion sound for successful operations
3. **error.mp3** - Error sound for failed operations
4. **notification.mp3** - Notification sound for alerts

## Recommendations

- Keep files small (< 50KB each)
- Use short sounds (< 1 second)
- Ensure sounds are pleasant and not intrusive
- Test volume levels across different devices

## Free Sound Resources

## Temporary Solution

Until you add actual sound files, the app will attempt to play these files but fail silently if they don't exist. The sound system will still work once you add the files.
